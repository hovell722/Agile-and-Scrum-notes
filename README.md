# Agile

## Origins of Agile

Software developers in the 80s and 90s experienced high levels of failed projects and noticed some common traits:
- Too much analysis upfront
- Restrictive change control
- Too many uncertainties

Software developers collaborated and experimented with new ways of working.

They took the successful ideas and wrote down a set of underlying values and principles:
- The Agile Manifesto for Software Development

### The Agile Manifesto

We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.

### The Agile Principles

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
preference to the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work
together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals.
Give them the environment and support they need,
and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of
conveying information to and within a development
team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence
and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity--the art of maximising the amount
of work not done--is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs
emerge from self-organising teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
its behaviour accordingly.

### Three Pillars of Empiricism

- Empiricism means working in an experience and evidence based manner so progress is based on reality, not fictitious plans.
- The Three Pillars are:
  - Transparency
    - Everyone present the facts as is and collectively collaborates for the common organisational objective. No one has a hidden agenda.
  - Inspection
    - Inspection is not done by an inspector but by everyone on the Scrum Team. The inspection can be done for the product, processes, people aspects, practices.
  - Adaption
    - Adaption is about continuous improvement, to adapt based on the results of the inspection. Everyone should reflect on how to improve.

### Scrum Teams

#### Roles

  - All doing whatever it takes to complete the agreed tasks.
  - Everyone is not just committed, but involved.

### Conduct of a Retrospective
The Goal:
- Identify a few specific things to improve and create an action plan for how to implement them.

The Agenda:
- Set the Stage
- Gather Data
- Generate Insights
- Decide What to Do
- Close the Retrospective

## User Stories

As a (type of user), I want (goal) so that (reason)

User stories do not include all the detail - they are only a pointer to the real requirement.

### Task
- Secondly, I'd like a place to sell and hire kit online. Parachutes, harnesses, lessons and all that. We also sell T-shirts an other memorabilia. It's got to look nice and load really quickly.

- As a user, I want to view what the products look like, so I can decide if I want to buy them.
